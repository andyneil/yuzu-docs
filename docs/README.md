# Yuzu

# What is it?

Yuzu is a simple framework and complementary tools designed to solve the problem of separation and integration between the UI and CMS to the conclusion of automated CMS production.

It's also effectively a generated pattern library composed of interlinking UI components that creates and integrates automatically with CMS solutions.

# Who is it for?

Anyone creating content led or CMS driven websites that are primarily focused on the production quality of HTML and CSS and UI state fidelity.

Yuzu is closely integrated with the Umbraco CMS, but the same principles will work for any CMS on any platform.

# Why?

We felt that the current selection of design systems based upon client side frameworks (e.g storybook) are overly complicated, are configured in code and require a greater understanding of coding.

By using the UI schema (or DNA) of content led sites we are able to use simpler technologies to get the same results from systems that are easier to understand.

Because we focus on the HTML and CSS, we free up the Javascript layer to implement one (or more) of the progressive frameworks (angular/vue/stimulus etc).

Yuzu also opens up other possibilities (bodyless websites) that wouldn't be possible using other solutions.
