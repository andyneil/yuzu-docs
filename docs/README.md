## what is it

a simple framework, with complimentary tools, designed to solve the problem of integration caused by separation between the UI and CMS to the conclusion of automated CMS production

## who is it for

anyone creating content led or CMS driven websites that are primarily focussed on the quality of HTML and CSS production and UI state fidelity

closely integrated with the Umbraco CMS but the same principles will work for any CMS on any platform

## why

we felt that the current stack of design systems based upon client side frameworks (e.g storybook) was overly complicated, look over the and required an understanding of coding

by using the UI schema (or DNA) of content led sites we are able to use simpler technologies to get the same results from systems that are easier to understand 

because we focus on the HTML and CSS we free up the javascript layer to implement one (or more) of the progressive frameworks (angular/vue/stimulus etc)

opens up other possibilities (bodyless websites) that wouldn't be possible using other solutions
