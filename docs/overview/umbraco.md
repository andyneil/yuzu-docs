# Umbraco Integration

Although the core of Yuzu is delivery application (CMS) agnostic we have released a series of modules that integrate strongly into the Umbraco CMS. They show how a CMS can be integrated at the core level and with specific editors that CMS's uses to define common UI structures.

Below is an introduction to each module that integrates with Umbraco

- core umbraco - an umbraco specific wrapper for yuzu.definition.core. Bootstraps Yuzu by registering components in the IOC container and adding the hbs helpers. Contains the default viewmodels for Links and Images and their mapping.
