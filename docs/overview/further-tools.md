# Further tools

on top of this simple interface we have created a collection of CMS agnostic tools that make the production of Yuzu sites easier. 

### Definition

- Pattern library / State management - an overlay to the template preview that allows the definitions developer to easily move between blocks that are organised into different types and areas. State data changes can be made in real time and saved to the solution within the overlay using our built-in State Management tool
- CLI - a simple command line interface to simply add new blocks, rename blocks or add new states.
