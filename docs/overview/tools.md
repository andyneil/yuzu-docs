# Tools

On top of this simple interface we have created a collection of CMS agnostic tools that make the production of Yuzu sites easier.

# Definition

- Template overlay containing:
    - Pattern library - allows the definition developer to easily move between blocks that are organised into different types and areas.  
    - State management - State data changes can be made in real time and saved to the solution within the template overlay so that definition developers can see the effects that state has on the design.

```
npm install yuzu-definition-ui
```
