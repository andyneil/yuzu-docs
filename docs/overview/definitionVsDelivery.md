# Definition and Delivery

Isn't that the same as saying frontend vs backend? 

Well we don't think that is a good distinction in 2020. In our opinion the word frontend and what it stands for have become much too muddied over the past 5 years as frontend has grown to encompass many different technologies and disciplines. 

With the growth of client side frameworks like React and Vue we have seen the backendification of the frontend where many of the same processes and programmatic skills that were once a part of the backend are now heavily used on the frontend. In recent years there has been a movement of backend developers to work in the frontend on such systems as their skillsets are well suited to these types of applications.

We feel that the words frontend and backback no longer signify the separation between developers that specialise in creation of the UI and those the implement the UI in a system. We finally settled on the words Definitions (developers who define what the UI is and how it behaves) and Delivery (developers who use the UI to delivery some content or functionality)
