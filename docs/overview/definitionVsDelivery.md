# Definition and Delivery

Isn't this the same as frontend vs backend? 

We don't think that is a good distinction in 2020. In our opinion the word frontend and what it stands for have become much too muddied over the past 5 years. Frontend has grown to encompass many different technologies and disciplines. 

With the growth of client side frameworks like React and Vue we have seen the "backendification" of the frontend where many of the same processes and programmatic skills that were once a part of the backend are now heavily used on the frontend. A consequence all of web development has compressed into the frontend.

We feel that the words frontend and backback no longer signify the separation between developers that specialise in creation of the UI and those the implement the UI in a system. We finally settled on the words Definitions (developers who define what the UI is and how it behaves) and Delivery (developers who use the UI to delivery some content or functionality)
