# Content creation

Creation of Umbraco content using page data states produced in Definition. 

We often find that Definition developers create example pages to demonstrates blocks working together. Commonly these use production content and assets. Rather than duplicate work and create the pages in Definition and Delivery this tool imports page data into Umbraco. 

## How does it work

- add a new content item for the document type / viewmodel that is going to be imported
- in the Yuzu Import dashboard click the `Content` for the viewmodel 
- choose the added content item and the definition data file 

That's it!
