# Forms

Forms is an integration with Umbraco Forms that connects to the form elements and form builder functionality in Yuzu. It allows a content editor to create their own bespoke forms from the Umbraco back office. By completely separating the form UI and treating each form element as a separate block forms become much easier to understand, maintain and control. 

## Yuzu Form Partial 

We created a new form partial to render the forms and handle context state changes, validation and form completion called YuzuForms.chtml.
